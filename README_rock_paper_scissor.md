# **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python**
This is a classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Python. It's a simple, command-line-based game where you play against the computer.

## **âœ¨ Features**
- ```Simple Interface:``` Easy to play directly in your terminal.

- ```Player vs. Computer:``` Test your luck against a computer opponent that chooses its move randomly.

- ```Clear Instructions:``` The game tells you which keys to press for Rock, Paper, or Scissor.

- ```Win/Loss/Draw Logic:``` The game automatically determines and displays the outcome of each round.

- ```Input Validation:``` If you enter an invalid character, the game will notify you and exit gracefully.

## **ðŸš€ Getting Started**
All you need is Python installed on your system to play this game.

## **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x

## **Running the Game**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., ```game.py```).

2. Open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

4. Run the script with the following command:
```bash
python game.py
```

## **ë£° How to Play**

1. When you run the script, you will be prompted to enter your choice.

2. Type one of the following and press Enter:

- ```r``` for Rock

- ```p``` for Paper

- ```s``` for Scissor

3. The game will display your choice and the computer's randomly selected choice.

4. The winner of the round will be announced, and the game will end.

## **ðŸ”¬ Code Logic**

- The game's logic is based on a simple numerical comparison:

- A dictionary maps the player's input ```('r', 'p', 's')``` to numerical values ```(1, -1, 0)```.

- The computer randomly selects one of these numerical values.

The winner is determined by comparing these two numbers. The specific logic ```(yc - c) == 2 or (yc - c) == -1``` cleverly covers the "losing" conditions (e.g., Paper vs. Scissor, Scissor vs. Rock). Any other non-draw outcome is a win.
